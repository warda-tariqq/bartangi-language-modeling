# Bartangi Language Modeling Resources

This repository contains code and resources for building a clean Bartangi language corpus, performing morphological lemmatization, training word embeddings (Skip-gram and CBOW), and visualizing embeddings for low-resource language modeling tasks.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

- Data Collection and Cleaning
- Morphological Analysis (Lemmatization)
- Word Embedding Training (Word2Vec: CBOW and Skip-gram)
- Embedding Visualization (PCA and t-SNE)
- Corpus preparation for future low-resource NLP tasks

## Data Source
We used the publicly available Bartangi corpus by Arseniy Novokshanov for initial data collection.
## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Requirements

Install Python 3.8+ and the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
